Hyperparameter Search and Optuna

# Overview
Hyperparameter search is a crucial step in machine learning model development. It involves finding the best set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning model to optimize its performance. Hyperparameters are external configurations that cannot be learned from the data and need to be set before training.

Optuna is an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework that automates the search process. It is designed for ease of use, flexibility, and efficiency, making it a popular choice among machine learning practitioners.

# Why Hyperparameter Search?
Machine learning models often have various hyperparameters, and selecting the right combination can significantly impact the model's performance. Manual tuning of hyperparameters is time-consuming and may not lead to the best results.

Hyperparameter search aims to automate this process, exploring the hyperparameter space efficiently and finding the optimal set of hyperparameters to improve model performance.

# Optuna Features
1. Flexible Objective Functions
Optuna allows you to define a flexible objective function that you want to optimize. This function typically involves training a machine learning model with a specific set of hyperparameters and evaluating its performance.

```
def objective(trial):
    # Define hyperparameters to be optimized
    param1 = trial.suggest_float('param1', 0.0, 1.0)
    param2 = trial.suggest_int('param2', 1, 100)
    
    # Train and evaluate the model
    score = train_and_evaluate_model(param1, param2)
    
    return score
```

1. Efficient Search Algorithms
Optuna provides various search algorithms such as TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) and CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) to explore the hyperparameter space efficiently.

```
study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize', sampler=optuna.samplers.TPESampler())
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
```

3. Visualization and Analysis
Optuna offers visualization tools to analyze the optimization process. You can visualize the optimization history, parameter importance, and more.

```
# Plot optimization history
optuna.visualization.plot_optimization_history(study)
```

# Getting Started
To get started with Optuna, you need to install the library:

Then, you can integrate Optuna into your machine learning workflow by defining an objective function, configuring the search space, and running the optimization process.

```
import optuna

# Define your objective function
def objective(trial):
    # ...
```

# Create a study object and optimize
```
study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
```
The objective function should return the metric to be evaluated. Val_loss as example should be minimized, accuracy on the other hand shold be maximized.

# In Training Rountine
The objective function receives the "trial" argument. 
In the training rountine:
1) Report the validation loss and epoch
   ```
   trial.report(val_loss, epoch)
   ```
2) Check if this model trainig should be pruned, if it shold be pruned then raise the exception as follows. Also delete any model or folder created.
```
    if trial.should_prune():
    raise optuna.exceptions.TrialPruned()
```



# Conclusion
Hyperparameter search with Optuna simplifies and automates the process of finding the best hyperparameter configuration for your machine learning models. It is a powerful tool that can save time and resources while improving the overall performance of your models.
