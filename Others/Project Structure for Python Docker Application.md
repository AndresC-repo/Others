Here's a recommended structure for your Python project running in a Docker container:

```
project_root/
│
├── src/
│   ├── args_parser.py
│   └── other_modules/
│       └── (other Python files)
│
├── data/
│   └── (data files to be loaded)
│
├── images/
│   └── (image files)
│
├── tests/
│   └── (test files)
│
├── main.py
├── Dockerfile
├── Makefile
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Explanation of the structure:

- **src/**: Contains all the Python source code
    - main.py: The entry point of your application
    - args_parser.py: For handling command-line arguments
    - other_modules/: Subdirectory for additional Python modules
- **data/**: Store all data files that need to be loaded by the application
- **images/**: Contains all image files used in the project
- **tests/**: Houses all test files for your project
- **Dockerfile**: Defines how to build your Docker image
- **Makefile**: Contains commands for building, running, and managing your project
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies
- **README.md**: Provides information about your project, how to set it up, and how to use it
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files should be ignored by version control

This structure keeps your project organized, separates concerns, and follows common Python project conventions. It also makes it easier to manage Docker-related files and data/image resources.
